## Setup
I try to keep the whole installation as simple as possible.

### Hardware Requirements
Not a whole lot

### Installation
No files to install yet. you'd just get a blue window with the UI overlay showing a tiny `Development Build` in the lower right corner.

### Running the game
Just double-click the (yet) non-existent `*.exe` file

## Contributing
As of right now contributions are neither needed nor wanted. This is due to the extremely early stage of development.

## Thanks
There's no one to thank

## Special Thanks
I wanna especially thank my partner for reminding me that I have to get some nutrition every now and then
